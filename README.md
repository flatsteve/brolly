# Brolly

A super simple app to tell you if you should take a brolly today.

Really just an excuse to learn some new React APIs and mess around.

### Development

- Install deps: `yarn`
- Run app locally: `yarn start`

### Deployment

- Build production: `yarn build`
- Add & commit: `git add dist && git commit -m "Release app"`
- Push to gh-pages: `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
