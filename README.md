# Brolly

A super simple app to tell you if you should take a brolly today.

Really just an excuse to learn some new React APIs and mess around.

### Development

- Install deps: `yarn`
- Run app locally: `yarn start`
- Run tests: `yarn test` or `yarn test-tdd`

### Deployment

- Run `yarn deploy` to push to GH pages

_Note: may have to delete the `gh-pages` branch on github first_
